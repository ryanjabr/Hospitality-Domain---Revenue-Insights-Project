# AtliQ Grands - Revenue Insights

In this project I've created a dashboard using power BI ,for the revenue management team of AtliQ Grand hotel chain, which can provide key insights on Revenue trend

## Problem Statement :

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

## Task :

- You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task.

- Create the metrics according to the metric list.

- Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.

- Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

## Tools :

Power BI - for data cleaning and visualization

 ## Step by Step Process :
 
- Imported and transformed data in Power BI.
  
    - I've used Power Query to connect to input folder and expanded CSV files.
  
    - Performed data transformation and established relationships in data modeling.


- Created calculated columns and measures in Power BI.
  
- And then I've Created few filters and key performance indicators.
  
- Finally created dashboard using appropriate visualization.
